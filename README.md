A Gift For My Son - Today was an amazing day. I was waiting for a very long time, but it finally arrived… It’s been nearly eight months since the last time I’ve seen him, and with every passing month my memory of his face gets fainter. It’s strange how time flies, isn’t it?Now he’s a man. - https://lowpriceshirt.com/family-gifts/gift-for-son/
